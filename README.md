# Deep Hedging Experiment: GAN vs Geometric Brownian Motion

## Research Question

Does training a deep hedger on GAN-generated worst-case price paths reduce the 95% CVaR of its P&L during real-world market crashes compared with a hedger trained on standard geometric-Brownian paths?

## Experimental Design

### Asset and Derivative
- **Asset**: S&P 500 E-mini futures (ES) - represented by SPY ETF
- **Derivative**: European ATM Call Option
- **Risk Metric**: CVaR 95% on daily P&L

### Architecture
- **GAN**: Generator and Discriminator with LSTM layers for worst-case path generation
- **Hedger**: Actor-Critic with two hidden LSTM layers
- **Environment**: Custom trading environment with transaction costs

### Hypothesis Testing
