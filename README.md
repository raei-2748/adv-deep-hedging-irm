# Deep Hedging Experiment: GAN vs Geometric Brownian Motion

## Research Question

Does training a deep hedger on GAN-generated worst-case price paths reduce the 95% CVaR of its P&L during real-world market crashes compared with a hedger trained on standard geometric-Brownian paths?

## Experimental Design

### Asset and Derivative
- **Asset**: S&P 500 E-mini futures (ES) - represented by SPY ETF
- **Derivative**: European ATM Call Option
- **Risk Metric**: CVaR 95% on daily P&L
- **Training Horizon**: 60-step episode (8-hour trading day with 8-minute bars)

### Architecture
- **GAN**: Generator and Discriminator with LSTM layers for worst-case path generation
- **Hedger**: Actor-Critic with two hidden LSTM layers
- **Environment**: Custom trading environment with transaction costs

### Hypothesis Testing
- **H0**: No difference in CVaR between GAN-trained and GBM-trained hedgers
- **H1**: Adversarial-trained hedger achieves 20% lower CVaR95

- Actor network: Policy for hedge position sizing
- Critic network: Value function estimation
- Tanh activation for bounded position sizes

### 5. DeepHedgingEnvironment
- Realistic trading environment
- Transaction costs modeling
- P&L calculation including option and hedge components
- CVaR-based reward function

### 6. TrainingManager
- GAN training with adversarial loss

- Alternating training between generator and hedger

## Installation and Setup

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run the experiment:
```bash
python experiment.py
```

## ðŸ”’ Deterministic Reproducibility

This experiment uses comprehensive deterministic seed control to ensure reproducible results:

### **Seed Control Features:**
- **Python random**: Controlled via `PYTHONHASHSEED`
- **NumPy random**: Deterministic array generation
- **PyTorch random**: CPU and GPU tensor generation
- **CUDA operations**: Deterministic GPU kernels
- **Model initialization**: Xavier uniform initialization

### **Verification:**
The experiment automatically verifies deterministic behavior by running multiple tests and comparing results.

### **Configuration:**
All seed settings are configurable in `src/deephedge/config.py`:
```python
TORCH_SEED = 42
NUMPY_SEED = 42
PYTHON_SEED = 42
DETERMINISTIC_MODE = True
CUDA_DETERMINISTIC = True
CUDA_BENCHMARK = False
```

## Experiment Flow

1. **Data Loading**: Fetch S&P 500 data or generate synthetic data
2. **Option Pricing**: Calculate option prices and Greeks for each timestep
3. **GAN Training**: Train generator to create worst-case price paths
4. **Hedger Training**: Train Actor-Critic hedger on GAN-generated paths
5. **Evaluation**: Test on historical crash periods (COVID-19, Dec 2018)
6. **Results**: Calculate CVaR, mean P&L, and generate visualizations

## Output

The experiment produces:
- Console output with training progress and results
- `deep_hedging_results.png` with four plots:
  - CVaR 95% comparison across crash periods
  - Mean P&L comparison
  - P&L time series
  - Cumulative P&L
